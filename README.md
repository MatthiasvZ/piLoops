# piLoops
A program that repeatedly searches for the first occurence as a string of the position in Pi of the previous string until the that process would loop.

There are two subprograms:

- **singleNum** follows this pattern using a user-given start number.

- **allNums** brute-force-checks all integer numbers (up to 1 000 000 which takes ~1â€“2 hours to reach) trying to find the most loop-resistant number.
